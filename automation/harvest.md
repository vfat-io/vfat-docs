# Automatic Harvest

Auto-Harvest automatically harvests your positions up to once per day, with the minimum earnings currently set to the equivalent of $50.

There is a 1.2% auto-harvest fee on rewards, part of which is used to pay for gas costs (no further user input needed).

The setting can be enabled in two places: 

Firstly in the general settings (gear icon on the top right).

![Settings](../img/automation/settings.png)

Secondly in the Harvest tab of any active position.

![Harvest](../img/automation/harvest.png)

It is enabled once per chain and applies to all positions on that chain. 

The general setting of Automation needs to be enabled as well, so this requires two transactions:
a) Enable Automation
b) Enable Auto-Harvest

These can then be disabled in the general settings.

Auto-Harvest and Auto-Compound are mutually exclusive, only one per chain can be enabled.
