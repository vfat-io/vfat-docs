# Automation

Sickle enables three different forms of automation:

[Auto-Harvest](harvest.md) automatically harvests earnings and optionally converts them to a different token.

[Auto-Compound](compound.md) automatically compounds earnings into each position.

[Auto-Rebalance](rebalance.md) automatically rebalances a concentrated liquidity position once it is out of range.

In order to use one of these, Automation first needs to be enabled on that chain (allowing our Automation contract to call these functions on behalf of your Sickle). For more information on how to enable each one please see their dedicated documents.
